# Oahu Pride Volleyball (OPV) Website

## Overview

This is a single-page website for Oahu Pride Volleyball (OPV) - an inclusive, all-gender grass volleyball league in Honolulu, Hawaii. The site serves as the digital presence for Season 4 (Fall 2025) of the league, which is affiliated with Aikāne ʻOhana, a 501(c)(3) organization.

The application is built as a full-stack React application with Express backend, featuring a vibrant Pride-themed design with an optional "Pride Mode" that transforms the site with rainbow gradients and animations.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework & Build Tools:**
- React 18+ with TypeScript for type safety
- Vite as the build tool and development server
- Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- React Query (@tanstack/react-query) for data fetching and state management

**UI Component System:**
- Shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives
- Tailwind CSS for styling with custom design tokens
- Components follow the "New York" style variant from Shadcn
- Custom Pride Mode theme system using React Context API

**Styling Approach:**
- Tailwind CSS with extensive customization via `tailwind.config.ts`
- CSS variables for theming (light mode base with Pride Mode overlay)
- **Trade Winds Sunset Color Palette:**
  - Pacific Navy #0B1F2A (193, 58%, 10%) - Primary text and headers
  - Lagoon #00A7C7 (190, 100%, 39%) - Secondary buttons and CTAs
  - Hibiscus #FF3E81 (339, 100%, 62%) - Primary buttons and highlights
  - Plumeria #FFD166 (42, 100%, 70%) - Accent color and badges
  - Sand #F7EFEA (23, 48%, 94%) - Background color
  - Signature gradient: `linear-gradient(135deg, #FF3E81, #FFD166 50%, #00A7C7)`
- **Typography System:**
  - Headings (h1, h2, h3): Barlow Condensed (font-display font-bold text-gray-800)
  - Body text: Inter (text-gray-700 for main content, text-gray-800 for emphasis)
  - Buttons/labels: font-semibold
  - Consistent font weights across all sections
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

**Key Design Patterns:**
- Context-based Pride Mode toggle (`PrideModeContext`) that applies body class and rainbow gradients
- Component-based architecture with separate files for each section (Hero, About, Features, Sponsors, etc.)
- Reusable UI components in `client/src/components/ui/`
- Page-level components in `client/src/pages/`

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework:**
- Express.js with TypeScript
- Node.js runtime
- Development mode uses tsx for hot reloading
- Production build uses esbuild for bundling

**API Structure:**
- Routes registered in `server/routes.ts` with `/api` prefix
- Currently minimal backend implementation (starter template)
- Session-based architecture prepared (connect-pg-simple for sessions)

**Development Setup:**
- Vite dev server proxy for API requests
- Hot module replacement in development
- Replit-specific plugins for error handling and debugging

### Data Storage

**Database:**
- PostgreSQL via Neon serverless driver (@neondatabase/serverless)
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe database queries
- Schema defined in `shared/schema.ts`
- Migrations managed with drizzle-kit in `migrations/` directory

**Current Schema:**
- Users table with id, username, password fields
- Prepared for authentication but not yet implemented
- Uses Zod for runtime validation via drizzle-zod

**Storage Pattern:**
- IStorage interface defines CRUD operations
- MemStorage implementation for in-memory fallback
- Database connection configured via DATABASE_URL environment variable
